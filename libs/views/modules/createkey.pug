        p Creating a new application is easy. Enter a valid name for your new application, such as #[span.text-dark Trackful analytics], and the full domain name of the website you want to track. Of course, you will have to have access to the websites source to initialise the #[a(href="/getting-started") Trackful plugin].
        p For the domain name, you'll need to enter the full URL to make sure it's parsed correctly. As an example #[span.text-dark http://yourdomain.io] would be valid but #[span.text-dark yourdomain.io] would not be.
